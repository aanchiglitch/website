Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Aanchal Kumari ðŸ˜ƒ

You have reached my small place on the World Wide Web.

I considered myself a Polymath. I believe in rigorous and intuitive learning. Spend the majority of the time exploring different types of algorithms and making some cool UI. Currently, I am a `2nd year` undergraduate at `Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar` pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering Department.
I am fascinated by the extensive impact computers can have on solving real-world problems. My interest lies in the fields of Algorithms, UI/UX and web developemnt.
My other interests and hobbies are Badminton, Gardening, History, Reading books, Writing stories and poetry.
