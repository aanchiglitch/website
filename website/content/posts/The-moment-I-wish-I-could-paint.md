It's silly, isn't it...\
Fighting for small things\
Wishing you could hold some things to yourself\
Selfish, totally\
After all I told the idiots, to meet me that evening\
But they were outside the campus\
Having my favorite street food all by themselves\
Bastards, I still comment that...\
But wishes for a sight, prevails still\
Making the anger, bring on a different level\
So angry, I said "What if it's our last meet for now"\
And heavens is known bad for granting you unwanted curses\
The country locked down, the college shut\
And sudden approaches to leave the city came the same morning\
There is nothing worse , then not seeing, not talking\
To some people, you don't know how you got connected with\
It hurts, and soaring you see the tickets\
Which don't excite you anymore\
'Cause your home is where your heart is\
The croaking walls of cell, bad food and water doesn't really matter\
I kept packing, taking to someone who told me be happy\
But inside I was going insane, and even more...\
'Cause with the rules and regulations\
There remains no chances to sight as I gain the insight\
Packed bags and all done...\
Pretty much no sleep...\
A cold water bath to keep conscious\
And help myself to with the load drowning my head\
It's 12:30 and I am listening to some song\
Which somehow cries of home and\
It's melodies send chills\
And my worthless phone rings\
Breaking in the continuous loop, bastards\
"We are reaching in 5 minutes, get everyone you got\
and meet at our spot, right now"\
My eyes brightened up... so I could see them\
There is no thing better\
I knew the places they meant right away, and\
Hurried with whatsoever left\
The smile which set me could not fade away\
And without any further delay\
We left for our way\
Somehow, they managed the leave they don't get\
You did the right thing, I was in a fortress of distress\
The railway station not so far, but every moment\
I had right then is what I rejoiced\
This time I would be gone, without the drinks\
Make sure idiots, next time don't forget this thing\
The train is at 6 and we are here by 1\
The 5 hours I had, are sure my best ones\
The night was partly cloudy\
But I could spot the stars\
The back seat of auto-rickshaw we seated in volunteering\
Those bad jokes and laugh, felt high itself\
It's partly dizzying, the rain,\
Cold swoosh of breeze  strangely exotic\
And then comes the scene ever hit in my head\
The one dark scene I want to paint to reality\
Alas! I am too bad for how lively it was\
I sat on some closed shops bench\
Having my 'Kulladh wali Chai'\
The street was all black, lit by a single street lamp\
Near the only small shop open\
Which made world's best Chai and omelets\
And I couldn't help bit stare at both of the idiots\
Who meant quite much to me\
Having Chai and lighing up a smoke\
Watching there smiling faces as they had small conversation\
The shopkeeper was interactive as well\
And every move put so perfectly as if I am in a movie\
I told them not to get me omelet but as if they will hear me\
They got me, and fed me\
And I must be an idiot as well\
To make excuses of not touching the oil\
'Cause let them feed me, I'm sorry, I will steal that\
We were crazy dancing and jumping on empty street\
Playing football on silent platform with some crushed bottle\
We laughed crazily, eating and playing\
I will never grow up, say I'm a kid to do these stupid things\
taking, hugging, what's infections, what's sanity?\
The night faded with the dawn\
And I am with you both\
My untimely leaving a secret\
Your leaving hostel a secret\
As the final hour approached, you got me to my seat\
The stop not few minutes, clear in all of our eyes\
How much we all will miss this, but can't leave with tears\
We will meet soon, we smiled and waved\
Keeping the emotions pressed, bastards\
The whistle came, and we shouted, every word a  slang\
'Cause we mean it, making each other laugh\
And see smiles before we lost sight of them ,\
In the silent, silent platform...\
I'm here now, at my house\
Not sure where my home is,\
And luckily get to hear your voices and see your faces\
Thanks to technology\
But that scene \
Of black night, cigarette smoke,\
Over salted eggs and dim street light,\
Those stars and mild rains\
Are ever stuck in my brain\
Your slightly wet, folded shirts\
Jackets I held, because you din't wear it\
Those colors, and smile\
Keeps coming to me again and again\
Sometimes as dreams, sometimes as nightmares\
But I am sure I miss that pure moment in every aspect\
Wish I could paint, what I see
