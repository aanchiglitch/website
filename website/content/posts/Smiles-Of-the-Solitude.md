It’s just, some things put a charm on me, and those are the chimes of blessings\
It’s been some time, and I say I am fine, and I realize what sets me free,\
Why people describe children as avatar of gods,\
Why chirping of birds as the midst of bliss,\
‘Cause some things which you can’t prevent, hold your heart down\
And you want to steal that felicity, from anyone\
And I treasured it all along, but sometimes you believe,\
Somehow those keys are in wrong hands, as treasures are perfect for heist.\
But the devil told me, do what it takes, let no one own it\
Greed is something, quite addictive, and so am I to my key\
Can’t get out the scandal, I put myself in, wanting for more,\
More precious feelings I wish to deal with, add specification to the smile\
I keep on my face, always there, with perfection, more like a lady\
And I keep on running and running, from one best thing to other\
Un-appealed, sabotaged,\
Looking for that factor, which adds the grace to my price\
Which makes me more expensive to be yours, or of anyone,\
Just as per the devil’s liking\
Little did I know, what I wish for, can’t be manufactured in lots\
For every unique material, it needs to be the one and only of its kind\
No matter what you buy from those big brands, likeness to add your value\
Can’t increase it, might be beloved and wished by everyone\
Makes it no creative\
For the ones left solitary, relying on originality rather than branding\
Holds the more expensive piece, yet begging for a living\
The ones everyone forgot, with the trends, of being outstanding\
I was quite angry, to be in such a low place, but leaves me thankful\
I don’t know if it was the texture of worthy material\
Or the heaviness in the shopkeepers voice, which I am yet not sure\
Was it teary or not, but for a moment which caught me,\
I knew it was there, when it was there, when I was so pleased\
With the poor man’s originality and his way of blessing\
Wishing the youth knew, what beauty relies in the hands which knit,\
Washed, and made every inch itself\
Wished it knew, how hard work it takes, to keep the taste alive\
To make a wonderful, perfection of a piece, a masterpiece\
And he does add those extra works; pull efforts, without a fee\
With only yet motive, the owner gives you all with a smile\
I am no thief, but I would steal that happiness and grace\
And add it my perfection and charm, and let it open to shine\
No matter who set its eye on it, you can’t snipe it\
Shared to me in forms of pure blessings\
‘Cause I took it from the smiles of the solitude.
